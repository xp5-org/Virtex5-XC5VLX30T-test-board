for XC5VLX30T-1FF665I-ND

I was able to pull 215 I/O pins over a 4 layer board without using blind or microvias. There are some significant compromises on the power delivery paths , im not certain if this will work for any practical design 

JTAG pins on the rear, clock and capacitors on the bottom GND plane side

2x4 headers for buck converters at the top of the board
